# natural language processing tools

While optimized versions of all these things exist, it's nice to have a clean
implementation of various NLP workhorses (hypergraph inside/outside, perceptron
& gradient training, etc.) lying around. Those will go here.

## currently implemented:

- Packed forest I-O with arbitrary semirings
- The expected counts semiring for log-linear models.

## to do

- A generic CKY parser
- Training algorithms: perceptron, gradient descent, EM
